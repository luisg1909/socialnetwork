# Facebook Clone

This is a simple **Facebook Clone** built with **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **SessionStorage**.

Users can register, log in, edit their profile, publish posts, and attach images — all in a simulated, interactive social network experience. No database or backend is required, as all data is stored in `sessionStorage`.
